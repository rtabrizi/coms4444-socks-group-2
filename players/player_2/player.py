"""Group 2 player: distribution-aware sock selection.

The policy has three parts, described in ``POLICY_CHANGES.md``:

1. Track the shade distribution of the socks we have seen, per colour, over a
   sliding window using Welford's online mean/variance update.
2. Use zero-embarrassment choices to improve the projected distribution.
3. Discard at most one leftover when a pristine replacement has lower
   estimated matching cost, and replacement needs and budget pace allow it.
